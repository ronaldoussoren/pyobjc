==============================
Using Cocoa collection classes
==============================

Cocoa contains a number of collection classes, including dictionaries and
arrays (like python lists) in mutable and immutable variations. We'll
demonstrate their usage using the ``NSMutableDictonary`` class.

We'll start by importing everything we need::

    >>> from Foundation import NSMutableDictionary

Then create an empty dictionary::

    >>> d = NSMutableDictionary.dictionary()
    >>> d
    {
    }
    >>> isinstance(d, dict)
    False
    >>> isinstance(d, NSMutableDictionary)
    True

You can add a new value using the Objective-C API::

    >>> d.setObject_forKey_(42, 'key2')
    >>> d
    {
        key2 = 42;
    }

But can also use the familiar python interface:

    >>> d['key1'] = 'hello'
    >>> d
    {
        key1 = hello;
        key2 = 42;
    }

The same is true for fetching elements::

    >>> d['key2']
    42
    >>> d.objectForKey_('key1')
    'hello'
