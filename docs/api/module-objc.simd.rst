:mod:`objc.simd` -- SIMD support for PyObjC
===========================================

.. module:: objc.simd
   :platform: macOS
   :synopsis: SIMD support for PyObjC

Introduction
------------

The module :mod:`objc.simd` provides types that are used
to support SIMD types in PyObjC.

The module contains two groups of types:

1. Vector types

   These types behave like numbers and support
   the usual numerical operators, as well as
   matrix multiplication.

2. Matrix types

   These are structs containing an array of
   vector types and don't support numerical operators.

.. note::

   This module only defines the SIMD types either used in
   Cocoa frameworks as wrapped by PyObjC, or needed to
   fully implement those types.

   This means that there obvious holes in the types
   described below. That is intentional.

Vector types
............

Only the first vector types is fully described. The other
types follow the same pattern, dropping fields as needed
(that is, a 4 element vector has attributes named *x*,
*y*, *z*, *w* to represent elements, a 2 element vector
only has *x* and *y*).

The exception to the rule is ``vector_uchar16``: This type
does not support the complicated ``__init__`` signature and
does not support named accessors to elements.

   are C *double* values.
