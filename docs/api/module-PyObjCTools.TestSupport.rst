.. module:: PyObjCTools.TestSupport
   :synopsis: Testing helpers

This module provides classes and functions that are
useful for testing PyObjC itself including the framework
wrappers.

.. warning::

   This module is primarily used for testing PyObjC
   and the API isn't fully stable.

.. function:: expectedFailureIf(condition)

   Decorator that marks a test as an expected failure
   if *condition* is true.

.. function:: no_autorelease_pool

   Decorator that disables the autorelease pool that's
   used for specific tests.

   .. versionadded: 8.2


.. function:: pyobjc_options(\**kwds)

   Contextmanager that sets attributes of :data:`objc.options`
   to the given values while running the body of the
   block.

.. function:: sdkForPython()

   Returns the SDK version used to compile Python,
   or :data:`None` when no version can be calculated.

   The SDK version is a tuple with the major
   and minor versions of macOS (for example ``(10, 8)``).

.. function:: fourcc(value)

   Returns the integer value of a four character code
   "literal".

   The *value* is a byte string of length 4 and contains
   the contents of the *char* C literal with
   the four character code, for example ``b"abcd"``.

.. function:: cast_int(value)

   Return *value* as if it were a 4 byte integer (using
   the overflow behavior of most CPUs)

.. function:: cast_longlong(value)

   Return *value* as if it were a 8 byte integer (using
   the overflow behavior of most CPUs)


.. function:: cast_uint(value)

   Return *value* as if it were a 4 byte unsigned integer (
   using the overflow behavior of C)

.. function:: cast_ulonglong(value)

   Return *value* as if it were a 8 byte unsigned integer (using
   the overflow behavior of C)

.. function:: os_release()

   Returns the release of macOS on the current machine.

   .. note::

      Before PyObjC 4.0.1 this returned the major release and
      left out the patch level.

.. function:: os_level_key(release)

   Return a value for *release* that can be used to compare
   two versions with the "<" and ">" operators.

.. function:: min_sdk_level(version)

   Decorator for enabling a test only when running with a build of PyObjC
   that was done with a recent enough SDK for macOS.

.. function:: max_sdk_level(version)

   Decorator for enabling a test only when running with a build of PyObjC
   that was done with an old enough SDK for macOS.

.. function:: min_os_level(version)

   Decorator for enabling a test only when running on a recent enough release
   of macOS.


.. function:: max_os_level(version)

   Decorator for enabling a test only when running on a old enough release
   of macOS.


.. _`leaks(1)`: https://www.manpagez.com/man/1/leaks/

.. class:: TestCase

   A subclass of :class:`unittest.TestCase` with some addition functionality. The
   most important addition is that each test gets run with a fresh autorelease pool.

   .. method:: run()

      Calls :meth:`unitest.TestCase.run`, but ensures that there is a fresh
      autorelease pool for every test. This makes is less likely that two
      tests accidentally influence each other.

      There will not be a fresh autorelease pool when :envvar:`PYOBJC_NO_AUTORELEASE`
      is in the shell environment.


      .. versionchanged:: 2.5
         Removed support for using the `leaks(1)`_ tool to check for memory leaks because
         that support was broken (cause test hangs) and didn't properly report leaks. This
         used to environment variable :envvar:`PyOBJC_USE_LEAKS` as a trigger to enable the
         functionality.
