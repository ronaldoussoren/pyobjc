Instantiating Objective-C objects
=================================


.. versionchanged:: 10.4

   The Pythonic interface for instantiation classes
   was added.

Objective-C uses a two step object instantiation
process, similar to Python's ``__new__`` and
``__init__`` methods, but with explicit invocation
of the methods ``alloc`` and ``init``. By default
this is mirrored in the Python proxies:

.. sourcecode:: python

   some_value = NSObject.alloc().init()

   some_button = NSButton.alloc().initWithFrame_(some_frame)


This looks very foreign in Python, therefore PyObjC
also supports a condensed version of this by directly
calling the class:

.. sourcecode:: python

   some_value = NSObject()

   some_button = NSButton(frame=some_frame)

The generic rules for instantiation objects through calling
the class are:

* Calling the class without arguments is supported unless
  the ``init`` method has been marked with ``NS_UNAVAILABLE``
  in Apple's SDK.

* Every instance selector of the Objective-C class with a name
  starting with ``init`` adds a possible set of keyword arguments
  using the following algorithm:

  1. Strip ``initWith`` or ``init`` from the start of the selector.

  2. Lowercase the first character of the result.

  3. All segments are now keyword only arguments, in that order.

  For example, given ``-[SomeClass initWithX:y:z]``, the
  following invocation is valid: ``SomeClass(x=1, y=2, z=3)``.
  Using the keywords in a different order is not valid.

* Some classes may have additional sets of keyword arguments
  that will be documented in the framework notes. In general
  those will be based on factory class methods for which there
  is no equivalent using the ``alloc().init...(...)`` pattern.


For classes in system frameworks the possible init methods are
For classes in system frameworks the possibly init method are
registered using framework data.

For classes implemented in Python the possible init methods
are detected automatically. Just implement one or more Objective-C
style init methods to add sets of keyword arguments for ``__new__``
(and don't implement ``__new__`` or ``__init__`` in the Python
class).

Set ``init`` to ``None`` to require using one or more keyword
arguments, that is:

.. sourcecode:: python

   class MyObject(NSObject):
       init = None  # Calling MyObject() is not allowed

       def initWithX_y_(self, x_value, y_value):
           self = super.init()
           self.x = x_value
           self.y = y_value
           return self

   value = MyObject(x=42, y=24)
