=======================================

PyObjC provides wrappers for a large number of frameworks on macOS. In
general all APIs in those frameworks are made available to Python programmers
using the the basic wrapping rules (LINK).

The documents below contain notes about specific APIs in the various
frameworks that are either not available to Python programmers, or using
an other interface that provided by the basic wrapping rules.
