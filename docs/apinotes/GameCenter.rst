API Notes: GameCenter framework
===============================

The full API is described in `Apple's documentation`__, both
the C and Objective-C APIs are available (but see the `API Notes`_ below).

.. __: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/?preferredLanguage=occ

These bindings are accessed through the ``GameCenter`` package (that is, ``import GameCenter``).

.. note::

   This is no longer a separate framework, but part of the GameKit
   framework. For backward compatibility the python package is still
   named GameCenter.
