API Notes: iTunesLibrary framework
==================================

The full API is described in `Apple's documentation`__, both
the C and Objective-C APIs are available (but see the `API Notes`_ below).

These bindings are accessed through the ``iTunesLibrary`` package (that is,
``import iTunesLibrary``).

   Apple's documentation mentions that these APIs will not return usable data
   unless the application has been code signed.
