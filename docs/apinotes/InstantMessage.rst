API Notes: InstantMessage framework
===================================

This framework was deprecated by Apple and documentation is no longer
available on Apple's developer website.

These bindings are accessed through the ``InstantMessage`` package (that is, ``import InstantMessage``).


API Notes
---------

All API's in the InstantMessage framework are wrapped by PyObjC.

The InstantMessage framework is deprecated in macOS 10.9, use the
Social framework instead (which is new in macOS 10.9)
