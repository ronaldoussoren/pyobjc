API Notes: InstallerPlugins framework
=====================================

These bindings are accessed through the ``InstallerPlugins`` package (that is, ``import InstallerPlugins``).

.. note::

   I cannot find documentation for this framework on Apple's developer
   website anymore, this likely means that this framework is on the
   way out (even if it doesn't appear to be officially deprecated).
