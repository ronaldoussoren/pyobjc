API Notes: XgridFoundation framework
====================================

PyObjC's bindings for the XgridFoundation framework are complete.

.. note:: 

   The XgridFoundation framework is not present in OSX 10.8 or later,
   which means the XgridFoundation package will raise ImportError when
   you try to use it on this release of OSX.
