long_description =
  PyObjC is a bridge between Python and Objective-C.  It allows full
  featured Cocoa applications to be written in pure Python.  It is also
  easy to use other frameworks containing Objective-C class libraries
  from Python and to mix in Objective-C, C and C++ source.
  $
  Python is a highly dynamic programming language with a shallow learning
  curve.  It combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.
  $
  PyObjC also supports full introspection of Objective-C classes and
  direct invocation of Objective-C APIs from the interactive interpreter.
