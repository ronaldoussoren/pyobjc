Generated types for C types
===========================

.. py:currentmodule:: objc

.. _type-struct::
Structure types
---------------

Structure are generated by :func:`objc.createStructType` and represent
a C structure, such as *NSPoint* or *CGRect*.

Structure types are all separate types, directly inheriting from :type:`object`,
and behave like a mutable variant of :func:`collections.namedtuple`.

The rest of this section describes :class:`StructureType`, which defines the
API of the structure types but does not exist as a real type.

.. class::  StructureType(\**kwds)

   A structure type.

   .. data:: _fields
      A tuple with the field names for this structure. Every name
      in *_fields* is present as an attribute of instances of the type.

   .. data:: __typestr__
      The type encoding for this structure type

   .. method:: __getitem__(idx)
      Return the *idx*-th element of the object. This also supports
      slices.

   .. method:: __setitem__(idx, value)
      Set the *idx*-th element of the object. This also supports
      slice, but the assignment is not allowed to change the number
      of elements.

   .. method:: copy()
      Returns a deep copy of the structure, that is all field values
      that are instances of a structure types are copied as well.

   .. method:: __pyobjc_copy__()
      An alias for :meth:`copy`, for use by PyObjC.

   .. method:: _replace(\**kwds)
      First create a copy of the object, then use the keyword arguments
      to replace the values of some attributes.

   .. method:: _asdict()
      Returns a dictionary where the keys are the values in :data:`_fields`
      and the values are the corresponding attribute values.


.. _type-opaque::
Opaque pointer types
--------------------

Opaque pointer are created by :func:`objc.createOpaquePointerType` and represent
opaque pointers or handles, such as values of type 'NSZone*'. Opaque pointers do
not have further structure or behavior, they just exist as blobs of data that are
returned from and passed to Objective-C functions or methods.

The rest of this section describes :class:`OpaquePointerType`, which defines the
API of the opaque pointer types but does not exist as a real type.

.. class::  OpaquePointerType(cobject=None, c_void_p=None)
   
   An opaque pointer type. Values are usually created by the PyObjC bridge,
   but can be created manually using one of the keyword arguments:

   * *cobject*: A PyCapsule object with name "objc.__opaque__" that represents 
     an opaque pointer value.
   * *c_void_p*: An instance of :type:`ctypes.c_void_p` or 
     :type:`int <__builtin__.int>` that represents an opaque pointer value.

   .. data:: __typestr__
      The type encoding for the opaque pointer type

   .. data:: __pointer__
      An integer with the raw pointer value

   .. method:: __c_void_p__()
      Returns a :type:`ctypes.c_void_p` instance with the raw pointer value

   .. method:: __cobject__()
      Returns a PyCapsule object with name "objc.__opaque__" representing
      the raw pointer value.
